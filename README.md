## Overview

This is my submission for my fifth Frontend Mentor project, built with vanilla HTML and CSS. Even though it is reccomended to have a "mobile-first" approach for the projects in this learning path, with the example I felt it not necessary being the design between desktop and mobile was not anything major. With that being said I still learned more responsive design methods with continued usage of media queries.

## My process

Like I mentioned in the overview, I decided against the "mobile-first" approach for this project since it didn't seem all too necessary with only minor differences between mobile and desktop displays. Also I was convinced to stick to the traditional approach thanks to the advice in this video: [The problem with mobile-first CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3k_IrXLNRc). All together with the traditional approach and a few learning curves to some new responsive design methods, I'd say my process still worked efficently and productively as ever.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex


### What I learned

Even though I ended up doing a traditional design practice, I still played around in the beginning setting my regular css properties to fit for mobile and my media queries to be set for bigger displays. Although there was definitely some confusion in the beginning having to work backwards basically, I got a better persective on how I would approach my next project if I were to do "mobile-first".

### Continued development

While I generally prefer to deepen my expertise in a select few programs rather than spread myself too thin, I am eager to start working with libraries more in the future. I'm seeking web design tips that will enable me to minimize time spent on styling so I can focus more on functionality.
